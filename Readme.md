# The course repository for Advanced Empirical Finance 2026

This repo initializes the folder structure for the course *Advanced Empirical Finance: Topics and Data Science* so that you can start working immediately. We will work with R *and* Python to write code in this course. We will use Quarto, an open-source technical publishing system, to create beautiful articles, slides, blogs, and more to communicate our results. Follow the few installation steps in [Exercise 0](https://advanced-empirical-finance.github.io/AEF-2026-course-homepage/exercises/technical-prerequisites.html) to ensure you have a running version of all the required software.

## Content of the repository

-   You find folders, `data-r` and `data-python`, already populated with some non-proprietary files. All proprietary files required to solve the exercise and assignments in this course will be made available via Absalon. I always assume you download the data and store it in the `data` folder of the course repository. You can download the files and include them in the data folder. That way, we have an identical folder structure, so you can run every code chunk from my slides without changing paths. It is **not** allowed to share the proprietary files publicly; thus, neither you nor I are allowed to push these files to a public repo.
-   The folder `mandatory-assignments` contains the files `MA_R_template.qmd` and `MA_python_template.qmd`, which you can use to understand the inner workings of `quarto` files. The file automatically generates .pdf documents, which comply with the formatting standards of this course.
-   The folder `lecture-slides` contains all lecture slides and the corresponding `.qmd` files I used to render the slides.

I will commit new changes regularly to the repository but alert you via 'Absalon' if any major change took place. To keep your local folder up-to-date, click on the `Source control` panel (`Str+Shift+G`). Then, click `.../Pull` to immediately update the local repository.
